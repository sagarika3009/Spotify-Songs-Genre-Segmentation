Users can search for music based on artist album or genre and can create edit and share playlists.Spotify works on freemium business model and generates revenues by selling premium streaming subscriptions to users and advertising placements to third parties. Through this project we will use the data available to us(from :https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks) and try to anlayze the current trend and predict popularity of songs by various categories like artists genres etc. Using various libraries of Python like pandas matplotlib numpy we will read the given data visualize plot predict the popularity ratings of the songs and their trends. Further to predict the popularity of the songs we will be Importing Sklearn libraries for Data Modelling &amp; Normalisation and Liner_Model Lasso XGBRegressor KNN for ML models to predict the popularity of songs. We are also importing the randint library to generate random numbers.</p>
